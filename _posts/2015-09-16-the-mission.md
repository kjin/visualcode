title: The Mission
---

The Visual Code project was started with the goal of creating a visual programming language that extends beyonds educational usage, and into real applications. In order to do so, it must be:

* *Intuitive* - not just from a beginner's perspective but also from the point of view of an experienced programmer. The language should aim to feel familiar to existing coders.
* *Mobile and cross-platform* - so that people can work on their code and run it wherever they want, be it Mac or Windows, desktop or tablet. Developers should be able to code effectively with not only the traditional mouse and keyboard but also with touch input.
* *Compatible with existing tools* - hopefully alleviating some of the difficulty associated with the lack of available support or libraries that would affect any new language. In other words, the language should be able to easily use third-party libraries that may be written in other languages, and be serializable in a source control-friendly format.

Having all these goals makes this project an ambitious one. Of course, I have no idea if it's possible, let alone feasible. So as I progress on the overall design of the language I make have to make amends to what is actually achievable.

### A departure from text languages

If it ain't broke, don't fix it - that's the expression that comes to mind here. Why create a visual language if text-based languages work fine? Especially when we have no idea how the development time, or the complexity of code, could change. For all we know, it could get much worse, and for minimal gain if at all.

But that's exactly why: I haven't seen a widely-used visual programming language (outside of educational purposes) at all before, and we won't know if it could actually be useful unless we try.

There is some truth to that idiom above, though - I want to stick to familiar languages as much as possible. C++, Java, and other OOP languages come to mind. In fact, I think one of the useful properties of the language should be bi-directional translation from and to an OOP language.

On the topic of programming paradigms, I want to design the language to with both OOP and functional programming styles in mind.

### The Blog

This is a developmental blog where I record my thoughts and progress towards creating a new visual language. There will occasionally be diagrams and mockups but even a prototype for the app will be a long way down the road.

Overall, I'm excited to start the project!
